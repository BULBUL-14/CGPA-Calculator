🎓 CGPA & SGPA Calculator System
A C++ based console application that manages student records and calculates SGPA and CGPA.
This project simulates a basic college result management system for students of Rajiv Gandhi Prodhyogiki Vishwavidyalay (RGPV), Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh.

📌 Features
✔ Add new student details
✔ Calculate SGPA (Semester Grade Point Average)
✔ Calculate CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average)
✔ Find topper of a specific department
✔ Find overall college topper
✔ Print detailed marksheet
✔ Display pass/fail status
✔ User-friendly menu-driven program

🛠 Technologies Used
• C++
• STL (Standard Template Library)
• vector
• string
• iomanip
• Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
• Structures
• Functions
• Modular Programming

📊 How SGPA is Calculated
Grade Point = Marks / 10
SGPA = (Σ (Grade Point × Credits)) / (Total Credits)

📈 How CGPA is Calculated
CGPA = (Sum of all Semester SGPAs) / (Number of Semesters)
